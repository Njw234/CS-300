## Overview
This repository showcases my work for CS-300, demonstrating my understanding of data structures and algorithm efficiency.  
It includes my runtime and memory analysis from Project One, and my working code from Project Two that sorts and prints courses in alphanumeric order.

## Reflection
**What was the problem you were solving?**  
I needed to design and analyze data structures that efficiently load, store, and retrieve course data for a university advising system.

**How did you approach the problem?**  
I implemented vector, hash table, and binary search tree structures to compare their runtime and memory usage.

**How did you overcome roadblocks?**  
I debugged parsing errors and refined validation logic to handle malformed or duplicate course entries.

**How has this expanded your approach to designing software?**  
It taught me how to evaluate trade-offs between complexity, efficiency, and maintainability.

**How has your work evolved your programming style?**  
I now focus on writing clean, modular, and documented code that prioritizes scalability and clarity.
